# Code Sample ‚Äì Predictive Modeling of Vaccine Uptake Behavior

**Author:** Wenlu Du  
**Position Applied:** Postgraduate Research Associate, Organizational Behavior

This repository contains an R-based code sample demonstrating my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning, applied to a longitudinal panel study on COVID-19 vaccination behavior.

The project integrates social psychology constructs with predictive modeling, drawing on both empirical RA work at Penn‚Äôs Social Action Lab and applied coursework in machine learning.

### üîç Key Features:
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and structuring 3-wave SPSS survey data
- **Theory-Driven Feature Engineering**: Variable mapping based on the 5C psychological model
- **Scoring & Reverse Coding**: Custom logic for transforming Likert responses into numeric inputs
- **Modeling Techniques**:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM)
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - ROC Curve analysis and AUC comparison
  - Confusion Matrix metrics
  - Visualization of model performance
- **Categorical Analysis**: Weight of Evidence (WoE) computation for demographic predictors

### üìÑ Use Case:
This code serves as a demonstration of both quantitative reasoning and applied technical ability, useful for research roles involving behavioral modeling, survey analysis, or organizational decision-making under uncertainty.

### üîê Data Note:
Due to confidentiality agreements, no raw participant data is included in this repository. All scripts are written using de-identified or illustrative variable structures.
